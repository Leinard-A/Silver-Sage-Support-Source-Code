#  SSS-Silver Sage Support 

This is a group project designed around providing a 
convienant, easily accessable method of getting into contact with a medical professional, such as General Practitioner or a specialist. 
Intended to work alongside existing medical infrastructure, 
this aims to provide an easier method of getting a medical consultation rather then waiting to see them in person.

## How it works

First you sign up to the service via: https://mi-linux.wlv.ac.uk/~2201213/Collab/, 
then when you log into your userpage request a text chat with a medical profession.
